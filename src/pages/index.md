  Welcome ðŸ‘‹

  I'm Vallis, a professional software developer and amateur photographer based in Edinburgh, Scotland. This site is my little space on the internet where I can share photos with family and friends, and experiment with new ideas in web development and design.

  Photography has been a part of my life for a long time, from taking snaps of my mates riding bikes in the woods when we were growing up to night club photography while at uni and more recently shooting weddings, events, travel, wildlife and theatre. I prefer not to specialise in one particular area of photography, keeping an open mind and trying new techniques as I discover them.

  I hope you enjoy taking a look around the gallery below. If you have any comments or feedback I'd love to hear from you!
