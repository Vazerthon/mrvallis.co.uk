  Welcome ðŸ‘‹

  I'm Vallis, a professional software developer and amateur photographer based in Edinburgh, Scotland. This site is my little space on the internet where I can share photos with family and friends, and experiment with new ideas in web development and design.

  Photography has been a part of my life for a long time, it's a creative outlet that has lead me from taking snaps of my mates riding bikes, to night club photography, weddings, events, travel, wildlife and theatre. I prefer not to specialise in one particular area of photography, keeping an open mind and trying new techniques as I discover them.

  I hope you enjoy taking a look around the gallery below. If you have any comments or feedback I'd love to hear from you!
